# Advent of Code Repository
This is a repository designated for the anually coding challenge ["Advent of Code"](https://adventofcode.com/) hosted by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

I primarily take part in this sort of event to test my knowledge and learn new approaches to solve problems by connecting with others within the event.
